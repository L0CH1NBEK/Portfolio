Projects that i have been doing so far
1. Human Activity Recognition with Machine Learning
Human activity recognition is the problem of classifying sequences of data recorded by specialized harnesses or smartphones into known well-defined Human activities.
It involves predicting the movement of a body, based on the sensor data, and involves deep knowledge of the domain from signal processing to correctly measure the features from the data to fit into a machine learning model.
2. Predict Customer Churn with Machine Learning
Prediction of Customer Churn means our beloved customers intending to leave us in the future. We do this by implementing a predictive model with the help of machine learning and python. 
3. Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
Sentiment relates to the meaning of a word and is associated with an opinion or an emotion, and analysis for a Data Scientist.
This is the process of looking at data and creating a binary classification using Machine Learning to learn and predict whether the movie reviews are positive or negative.
4. Bitcoin Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Bitcoin is the very first decentralized digital currency. This means this is not being governed by the government or by any central bank or any other authority.
In this project, I build your Python program with the Machine Learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines, so trading and making money might be available.
5. Movie Recommendation System with Machine Learning
Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s busy world. People are always short with their time and try to accomplish the work in their limited 24 hours.
The purpose of a recommendation system is basically to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. In this project, I did a Movie Recommendation system with Machine Learning.
